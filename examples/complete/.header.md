# ECS Deployment Complete

Configuration in this directory creates:

- ECS Service in a pre-configured ECS Cluster and corresponding ECS Capacity Providers
- Internet-facing Application Load Balancer to access the deployed services, and
- ACM to generate an Amazon-issued certificate for a base domain, and then create a Route53 A-type record with an endpoint

## Usage

To run this example, you will need to execute the commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Please note that this example may create resources that can incur monetary charges on your AWS bill. You can run `terraform destroy` when you no longer need the resources.
