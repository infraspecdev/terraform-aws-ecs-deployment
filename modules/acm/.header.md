# acm

This sub-module creates the Amazon-issued certificates for given domains with `validation_option` configuration.

## Presets

- The `validation_method` is set to `DNS` as the recommended method, and can be overridden to use `EMAIL` method if required.

## Notes

- ACM certificates are created before destroying existing ones (to update the configuration), which is the recommended practice.
- The sub-module outputs the corresponding validation records for every Amazon-issued ACM certificate created. This can be further used to complete the validation by creating the Route53 DNS records.
