# acm

This sub-module creates the Amazon-issued certificate for a given domain with `validation_option` configuration.

## Presets

### ACM Certificate

- The `validation_method` is set to `DNS` as the recommended method, and can be overridden to use `EMAIL` method if required.

### Route53 Record

- The `allow_override` is set to `true` as the default option, and can be overridden to `false` if required.

## Notes

- ACM certificate is created before destroying the existing one (to update the configuration), which is the recommended practice.
