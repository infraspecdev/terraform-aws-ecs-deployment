# s3-bucket

This sub-module creates an S3 bucket with optional S3 bucket policies to attach.

## Presets

### S3 Bucket

- The `force_destroy` is set to `false` as the default option (which prevents the deletion of the S3 bucket if it has objects in it), and can be overridden to be `true`.

### S3 Bucket Policy

- The `effect` under `statement` in the `aws_iam_policy_document.this` data source is set to `Allow` as the default option (which grants the principal the defined permissions), and can be overridden to be `Deny`.

## Notes

- The S3 bucket policies are attached only if at least one policy is specified. Otherwise, no bucket policies are attached.
